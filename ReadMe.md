### Project Ideas:

> 1. Sports Hub (Approved)

Many students and young adults love to play soccer on the weekends with friends, but sometimes their friends are not free to play with them. This application will allow users to log in with their twitter credentials and gain access to local available games in the area. The application will have to store a database of all public soccer fields. The application will also track data (location and time) from Twitter hashtags of available games, which will then send notifications to available players within the area. The application will have an available games page which will show all available games within the area of the user. 

**Proposed methodologies** - Node.js, JavaScript, MySQL, IBM Watson Cognitive Services.


> 2. Complain Me

Many times there is a gap between student and faculty due to either the strict nature of professor or shy nature of student. Complain Me is an Anonymous feedback system where user can feedback or post questions without declaring his/her identity on a lecture basis too if he/she wants. There they can ask professors to repeat certain topic again or complain about some difficulties like in group project or class disturbance or to tell something to Professor which generally they can’t say in-person. It will give a facility of every lecture feedback (optional), exam feedback (optional) and final feedback after course completion(Mandatory). Then based on all these results Janus graph and Data science exercise can generate and analyse data that which professor needs more efforts, where he is failing with students and who is going perfect. The data analysis will result in the overall impression of faculty and his involvement. Which will result in a better version of new class every semester and freshers can also select appropriate faculty and the Student-Professor relation will be more friendly and transparent.

**Proposed methodologies** - MySQL or similar Database, IBM Cloud Services, UI tools for form formation.


> 3. Student Library App

The Project will be about the student library. Students can issue laptops and books for one week currently. But there is no transparency in the system. One has to wait and is unknown if he/she will find the laptop of his will or not. Also the book one wants can or cannot be there. This application will create a system where students can see all the resources of the library using the same database. Students can see all the electronic gadgets and all the books with the number of copies available in the library. They can then book it online and get if they come in next 2 hours. This application will also lure students about the products that library have and the latest releases. Also the top books to be issued by the students will be displayed in the order with their description so students can refer to those books depending on their field of study.

**Proposed methodologies** -  MEAN Stack, IBM Watson API and Node Red.
